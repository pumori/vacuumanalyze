# Database Security Audit Presentation

## Slide 1: Title Slide

- **Title**: Proactive Database Security Audit System
- **Subtitle**: Ensuring SOC 1 Compliance for Oracle and PostgreSQL
- **Presented by**: Database Operations Team
- **Date**: April 2025

## Slide 2: Introduction

- **Purpose**: Implement weekly automated security checks
- **Objective**: Ensure compliance with SOC 1 audit requirements
- **Scope**: Oracle and PostgreSQL databases
- **Benefit**: Prevent audit flags and reduce firefighting

## Slide 3: Current Challenges

- Manual checks are time-consuming
- SOC 1 audits every 6 months create pressure
- Last-minute fixes disrupt operations
- Inconsistent profile assignments
- Weak password policies

## Slide 4: Proposed Solution

- **Automated Python Script**:
  - Checks Oracle database profiles
  - Verifies password expiry (170 days)
  - Ensures complex password verification
  - Generates HTML reports
- **Weekly Execution**:
  - Read-only account access
  - Identifies non-compliant accounts
  - Suggests corrective actions
- **Future Expansion**:
  - Add PostgreSQL checks
  - Include additional security parameters

## Slide 5: Oracle Check Details

- **Current Implementation**:
  - Verifies profile assignment (DBA_PROFILE)
  - Checks password expiry duration
  - Confirms password verification function
- **Report Features**:
  - Lists non-compliant accounts
  - Details specific issues
  - Provides remediation steps
- **Sample Finding**:
  - "User X: Password expiry 90 days, no verification function"
  - Recommendation: "Assign DBA_PROFILE with 170-day expiry"

## Slide 6: Benefits

- Proactive issue identification
- Reduced audit preparation time
- Consistent security posture
- Automated documentation
- Scalable for additional checks
- Minimizes operational disruptions

## Slide 7: Implementation Plan

- **Phase 1**: Oracle checks (Completed)
  - Deploy weekly script
  - Monitor reports
  - Fix identified issues
- **Phase 2**: PostgreSQL checks (Q3 2025)
  - Develop similar checks
  - Integrate into existing framework
- **Phase 3**: Enhanced checks (Q4 2025)
  - Add role-based access checks
  - Include privilege audits
- **Weekly Schedule**:
  - Run every Monday
  - Review reports by Wednesday
  - Fix issues by Friday

## Slide 8: Expected Outcomes

- 100% SOC 1 compliance
- Zero audit flags
- Reduced manual effort
- Improved team confidence
- Stronger security posture
- Documented compliance history

## Slide 9: Next Steps

- Approve weekly check implementation
- Assign team for report review
- Plan PostgreSQL integration
- Schedule training on report analysis
- Set up alerting for critical issues
